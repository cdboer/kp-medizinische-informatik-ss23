# ️🧑‍⚕️ Predicting Sepsis Onset in ICU Patients - Komplexpraktikum Medizinische Informatik 1 ST23

The "Komplexpraktikum Medizinische Informatik 1" [practical course on medical computer science] took place at TU Dresden during the summer term of 2023.
Using the [MIMIC-IV database](https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/), we developed a machine learning model to predict the onset of sepsis in patients admitted to the ICU.
The project's code is available in this repository.
The repository was made public following the project's conclusion in accordance with Section 9 of the [PhysioNet Credentialed Health Data Use Agreement 1.5.0](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/view-dua/2.2/).

You can learn more about our study's design, methodology, and findings, by reading our paper.

The project was directed by Dr. Markus Wolfien and carried out by Jonas Höpner and Claas de Boer under the supervision of Ian-Christopher Jung, Waldemar Hahn, and Katharina Schuler of the [Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry](https://tu-dresden.de/med/mf/imb?set_language=en).
