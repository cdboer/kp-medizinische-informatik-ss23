<h1 align="center">Komplexpraktikum Medizinische Informatik 1 ST23</h2>

In the summer term of 2023, the TU Dresden held the "Komplexpraktikum Medizinische Informatik 1" (practical course in medical computer science).
During this course, we developed a machine learning model to predict the onset of sepsis in patients admitted to the ICU using the [MIMIC-IV database](https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/).
The project's code is available in this repository.
The repository was made public following the project's conclusion in accordance with Section 9 of the [PhysioNet Credentialed Health Data Use Agreement 1.5.0](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/view-dua/2.2/).

You can learn more about our study's design, methodology, and findings, by reading our paper.

The project was directed by Dr. Markus Wolfien and carried out by Jonas H√∂pner and Claas de Boer under the supervision of Ian-Christopher Jung, Waldemar Hahn, and Katharina Schuler of the [Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry](https://tu-dresden.de/med/mf/imb?set_language=en).
